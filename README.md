## Problem:

`n mobile robots are initially placed on a cycle; 
they can move in either direction with maximum speed 1; 
they can communicate only F2F (Face-to-Face) and do not know each other’s location on the cycle. 

• To rendezvous they execute the following algorithm: 

1. Each robot flips a fair coin and goes L(eft) or R(ight) depending on the outcome.

2. When two robots meet they merge into one robot and this robot flips a fair coin and goes L or R depending on the outcome. 

• The question is what is the rendezvous time? It might be interesting even for robots with different speeds.
