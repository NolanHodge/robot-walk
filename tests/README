robot-walk test suite

Running shell scripts with ./ works with chmod +x *.sh or prepend '/bin/sh ' to any script

Declare the amount of robots by specifying first argument on cmd line

Ex: ./test-robot-walk.sh 2
Ex: ./test-robot-walk-ui.sh 2

Build source by specifying -b after roubot count

Ex: ./test-robot-walk.sh 2 -b
Ex: ./test-robot-walk-ui.sh 2 -b
